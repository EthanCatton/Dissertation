To know which libraries are needed check the imports of the python file.

One of the imports for keras flags as an error in the IDE used to make this code, if this occurs elsewhere the code should still run.

The "rules" for the mitigation process, what the system looks for, are arbitrarily chosen to demonstrate the system, the values used have not
been intentionally chosen to reflect signs of APTs from the dataset.

Mitigation is currently set to run off all labelled APT records. To alter this to only use detection guess change the mode variable 
in mitigation_rule(). 

Most of the important variables to tuning are global variables allowing them to be changed all in one place under the imports.

The two csvs used in detection are from the unravelled dataset. Check the dataset section of the paper for the reference.

Analysis uses an example pdf as its input, see the dataset section for the reasoning.
